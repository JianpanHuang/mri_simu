This repository contains Matlab code for the MRI part of the BME2103 course.

magn1: Simulate the magnetization precession under B0.

magn2: Simulate the magnetization precession under B0 during the 90 RF pulse (B1) excitation.

magn3: Simulate the magnetization relaxation under B0 after the 90 RF pulse (B1) excitation.

magn4: Simulate the magnetization precession under B0 after the 90 RF pulse (B1) excitation (signal detection).
