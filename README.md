# mri_simu
This repository contains Matlab code for simulating magnetization precession and relaxation in the MRI part of the BME2103 course.

s1: Simulate the magnetization precession under B0.

s2: Simulate the magnetization precession under B0 during the 90 RF pulse (B1) excitation.

s3: Simulate the magnetization relaxation under B0 after the 90 RF pulse (B1) excitation.

s4: Simulate the magnetization precession under B0 after the 90 RF pulse (B1) excitation (signal detection).
