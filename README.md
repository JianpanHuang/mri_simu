# mri_simu
This repository contains Matlab codes of MRI for educational purposes

magn1: Simulate the magnetization precession under B0.

magn2: Simulate the magnetization precession under B0 during the 90 RF pulse (B1) excitation.

magn3: Simulate the magnetization relaxation under B0 after the 90 RF pulse (B1) excitation.

magn4: Simulate the magnetization precession under B0 after the 90 RF pulse (B1) excitation (signal detection).

nmr_fft: to demonstrate the Fourier transform of a free induction decay (FID) to an NMR spectrum.

mri_fft: to demonstrate the Fourier transform of an image to a k-space, and vice versa.
